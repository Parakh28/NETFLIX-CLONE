#first time using React.

Page Loading is Slow.
Animation and UI could be better.
Most Netflix Originals are not embedded with their repective yt Trailer links because the api is not able to fetch them.
Button Functionality is minimal.
Unable to add proper functionality for "Add to List" button due to time constraint.
